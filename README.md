Introducing HACKreCAPTCHA

HACKreCAPTCHA is an easy-to-use anti-anti-robot tool to help users solve some ridiculously hard questions generated by reCAPTCHA.

How HACKreCAPTCHA works?

The main steps of how it works are as follows: 

1. Capture the images generated by reCAPTCHA; 

2. Extract the keyword in the question; 

3. Use Thesaurus to find all possible synonyms of that keyword - List synonyms_keyword; 

4. Use Clarifai to generate the tags of each images - List tags; 

5. Compare List tags with List synonyms_keyword, if there are words from two lists match with each other, the corresponding image will be selected as one of the correct images.
